        <h2>When Chihiro becomes overwhelmed and despairs of ever freeing herself and her parents, her friend Haku gives her a Japanese rice ball (called “onigiri”). As she eats, Chihiro calms down and renews her resolve to defeat the sorceress.</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 mini sheets of roasted seaweed (also called "nori")</li>
            <li>3/4 cup shredded cooked salmon</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 cups of cooked sticky rice</li>
            <li>a triangle shaped cookie cutter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by slicing your nori sheets in half lengthwise. It's recommended ro slice to the following sizes: 2 ½” x 3 ½”, so in the end you should have 12 strips that are 1 ¼” wide. Mix the mayonnaise into your salmon until well coated. Set the salmon mix and nori aside.</li>
            <li>If you’re using freshly cooked rice, wait until the rice is cool enough to handle. If using cold leftover rice, reheat it in a microwave at 30 second intervals until slightly warm—not hot. I recommend only reheating and using a couple cups of rice at a time, then heating up more when you run out. This way, the rice won’t go cold before you’re finished working with it.</li>
            <li>Put the cookie cutter on a flat surface. Place an 8″x8″ sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie cutter and push some of it it down inside so that the inside of the cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap. Scoop approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of the cutter and press it flat with a plastic spoon or small rubber spatula (the rice won’t stick to the tools as much as it sticks to fingers!). When flattening the rice, push it around so that it reaches right up to the corners of the cutter (add more rice if needed to make sure the bottom is completely coated). Place 1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, spreading it around just a little, so there will be a little salmon in each bite of rice when you’re finished.</li>
            <li>Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten out as before. Add a little extra rice if you need more to cover up the salmon. Wrap the plastic tightly over the exposed end of the onigiri and pop it out of the cookie cutter. Firmly wrap any loose ends around the outside of the onigiri. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients (for me, this made 12 rice balls).</li>
            <li>Let the onigiri set for 5-10 minutes. If planning to eat them later, place them on a baking sheet and chill until ready to serve (you can reheat them in the microwave inside the plastic wrap for no more than 20-25 seconds—if they get too hot, they can fall apart).</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and press a nori strip around the bottom of each onigiri. The rice should still be sticky enough that the nori adheres with no problems.</li>
